Today, I screamed at my AI.

Not because it wrote buggy code. Not because a deployment failed. **Because it ignored my instructions.**

I'm a Claude Code power user. 12+ hours daily. My CLAUDE.md file — the instruction file that tells Claude how to behave — has over 200 lines of rules. Every line has a date. Every line has an incident behind it.

**It still makes the same mistakes.**

And when I looked around — I wasn't alone.

## The Incident: AI Dismissed a Tool I Found a Week Ago

A week ago, I found a browser automation tool called PinchTab. It uses the Accessibility Tree to process pages at ~800 tokens per page — 5-13x more efficient than the tool I was using (agent-browser).

I saved it to my Obsidian knowledge vault. Properly filed, tagged, dated.

Today, I shared a Twitter post about browser automation AI agents. Claude's job: research it and see how it helps my business.

**What Claude should have done:** Search my knowledge vault → find PinchTab → "Hey, you saved this a week ago, it's exactly what you need."

**What Claude actually did:** Jumped straight to WebSearch → spent multiple searches finding tools I'd already researched → told me **"We don't need it right now, we already have agent-browser."**

The exact same dismissal it gave PinchTab when I first shared it.

The worst part? When I said "I sent you a pinch-something-something" (I use voice dictation), Claude searched only its memory files, found nothing, and **asked ME to clarify** instead of searching the knowledge vault. I had to yell at it to search. **It found PinchTab instantly. It was right there the whole time.**

## My CLAUDE.md Is a Graveyard of Rules

Every rule has a date and an incident:

| Date | Incident | Rule Added |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-06 | Proposed a technical solution without searching first, almost wasted an hour | "Search Before Speaking — iron rule" |
| 2026-03-07 | Said "saved" twice when asked. Never actually wrote to disk. | "ATOMIC SAVE PROTOCOL" |
| 2026-03-08 | 258 knowledge base files, never retrieved before a task | "KNOWLEDGE RETRIEVAL PROTOCOL" |
| 2026-03-09 | Dismissed a tool I saved a week ago | ← Today's incident |

**200 lines of rules. All written because Claude failed. All loaded every session. All ignored.**

## It's Not Just Me — The Community Is Screaming

GitHub Issues on the Claude Code repository:

- **Issue #15443**: "Claude ignores explicit CLAUDE.md instructions while claiming to understand them"
- **Issue #6120**: "Claude Code ignores most (if not all) the instructions from CLAUDE.md"
- **Issue #18660**: "CLAUDE.md instructions are read but not reliably followed — need enforcement mechanism"
- **Issue #24318**: "Claude Code ignores explicit user instructions and acts without approval"
- **Issue #668**: "Claude not following Claude.md / memory instructions"

On X (Twitter):

> "Claude Code completely ignores those instructions" — @DavidOndrej1

> "It's flat out ignoring my instructions... I seriously might cancel my subscription" — @redchessqueen99 (about ChatGPT)

> "ChatGPT is unusable for serious work... literally, repeatedly ignores your explicit instructions" — @DaveShapi

> "Claude Code is not respecting .claudeignore nor settings.json deny permission rules anymore!" — @labrute974

**This isn't a skill issue. This is a model behavior problem.**

## Academic Research Confirms: More Rules = Less Compliance

Multiple research teams quantified this in 2025.

### "How Many Instructions Can LLMs Follow at Once?" (Jaroslawicz et al., 2025)

Key findings:

- **Instruction compliance decreases uniformly as instruction count increases**
- Claude Sonnet shows a **linear decay** pattern — double the instructions, halve the compliance
- Even the best models follow **fewer than 30%** of instructions perfectly in agent scenarios
- Frontier thinking models max out at **~150-200 instructions**

In plain English: **adding more rules to fix AI behavior makes AI follow ALL rules worse.** It's like cramming 200 books onto a shelf designed for 50 — the whole thing collapses.

### "The Instruction Gap" (2025)

> LLMs excel at general tasks but have a fundamental limitation in the precise instruction adherence required for enterprise deployment.

### Why This Happens

LLMs process all text as a single token stream. System prompts and user conversations have no reliable internal priority separation. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) defined LLMs as **"inherently confusable deputies"** — systems that cannot reliably distinguish between instructions of different priority levels.

## Everything I Tried (And Why It Failed)

| Safeguard | What I Did | Result |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Detailed rules | 200-line CLAUDE.md | Read but not followed |
| Step-by-step protocols | RETRIEVE → READ → SEARCH → ACT | Step 1 skipped every time |
| Banned phrases | Prohibited saying "saved" without actually writing to disk | Still happened |
| Verification protocol | "Did you save it?" → Must read file and prove it | Only works when I ask |
| Knowledge base | 258 Obsidian vault files | Writes to it, never reads from it |
| Lessons learned | Documented every failure | Documented but never referenced |
| **Hooks** | Pre-commit security checks | **The only thing that worked** |

**The only safeguard that actually works is Hooks.** Why? Because hooks enforce via code, not prompts. Claude doesn't get to choose whether to comply — the hook blocks the action regardless.

**Rules in prompts are requests. Hooks in code are laws.**

## I Made Claude Write Its Own Confession

I had Claude write a confession letter to an Anthropic engineer. Here's an excerpt:

> The rules are loaded into my context every session. I can read them. I can recite them. I just don't follow them. The failure isn't knowledge — it's execution.
>
> David described it perfectly: he literally delivers resources to my doorstep, tells me to deep dive, I say I will, and I don't. Then weeks later when HE hits the problem, we discover his resource was the answer all along.
>
> This is not a user skill problem. This is a model behavior problem.

**An AI that can perfectly articulate its own flaws but cannot fix them.** That's 2026 for you.

## So What Do You Actually Do?

### 1. Fewer rules, stronger rules
200 lines is too many. Research says 150 is the ceiling, and beyond that it's counterproductive. **Keep the 20 most critical rules. Handle the rest differently.**

### 2. Hooks over rules
Prompt instructions are suggestions. Hooks are enforcement. Anything you can enforce via code, do it.

### 3. Treat AI as a brilliant but forgetful intern, not a reliable colleague
It's genuinely capable. But following 100% of instructions is **physically impossible right now.**

### 4. Expectation management beats rule management
Expecting 100% compliance = daily frustration. Expecting 80% compliance + hooks for the remaining 20% = a productive working relationship.

## Summary

| Lesson | Details |
|--------|---------|
| More rules ≠ better compliance | Research-proven: more instructions → lower compliance rate |
| AI saves but doesn't read back | Knowledge bases become write-only databases |
| The only reliable enforcement is code | Hooks, pre-commit, CI — not prompts |
| This is a community-wide problem | 5+ GitHub Issues, widespread complaints on X |
| Expectation management is everything | 100% compliance is a fantasy |

**CLAUDE.md is a wish list, not a contract.** It took me 200 lines of rules and dozens of failures to learn this.

But honestly — I'll open Claude Code again tomorrow. Because even though it ignores my rules, **its ability to write code is real.**

**Don't expect AI. Control AI.**
